            Christmas is an anual festival commemorating the birth of <b>Jesus Christ</b>, observerd primarilly on December 25<sup>th</sup> as a <b>religious and cultural</b> celebration among billions of people around the world.    
            A liturgucal feast central to Christianity, Christmas prepration begins on <b>First Sunday of Advent and it is followed by Christmastide</b>, 
            which historically in West lasts twelve days and culminates on Twelth night.
            Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is observerd religiously by a majority of Christmas, as well as celebrated culturally by many non-Christians, 
            and forms an integral part of annual holiday seasons.

            The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of Jesus, says that Jesus was born in <b>Bathlehem</b>, 
            in accordance with <b>messianic prophecies</b>. When <b>Joseph</b> and <b>Mary</b> arrived in the City, the inn had no rooms, and so they were offered a 
            stable where the <b>Christ Child</b> was soon born, with <b>angles</b> proclaiming this news to <b>shepherds</b>, who then spread the word.

            <h2>Nativity</h2>
            The goslepls of <b>Luke</b> and <b>Matthew</b> describes Jesus as being born in <b>Bethlehem</b> to the <b>Virgin Mary</b>. 
            In the Gospel of Luke, Joseph and Mary travel from <b>Nazareth</b> to Bethlegem in order to be conunted for census, and Jesus is born there and placed in a 
            manger. Angles proclaim him a savior for all people, and three shepherds come to adore him. In the Gospel of Matthew, by contrast, three magi follow a star 
            to Bethlegem to bring gifts to Jesus, born the <b>king of the Jews. King Herod</b> orders the massacre of all the boys less than two years old in Bethlegem, 
            but the family flees to Egypt and later returns to Nazareth.

            <h2> Church Attendance </h2>
            Christmas Day (inclusive of its <b>vigil</b>, Christmas Eve), is a Festival in the <b>Lutheran Chrurches</b>, a solemnity in the Roman Catholic Chruch, 
            and a Principal Feast of the Anglican Communuin. Other Christian denominations do not rank their feast days but nevertheless place importance on Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, 
            as with other Christian feasts like Easter, Ascension Day, Pentecost. As such, for Christians, attending a Christmas Eve or Christamas Day <b>church service</b> plays an important part
            in the recognition of the Christmas season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of the highest annual church attendance. A 2010 survey by <b>LifeWay Christian Resources</b> found that 
            six in ten Americans attend church services during this time. In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of 2.5 million people at 
            Christmas services in 2015.
